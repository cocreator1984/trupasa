&nbsp;How to use (Windows)



&nbsp; - Build: ./scripts/build.ps1

&nbsp; - Launch dev (non-blocking): ./scripts/launch.ps1 -Mode dev -Detach

&nbsp; - Launch prod (non-blocking): ./scripts/launch.ps1 -Mode start -Detach

&nbsp; - If you prefer to watch logs in the terminal, omit -Detach (it will tail logs). Use Ctrl+C to stop when tailing.
